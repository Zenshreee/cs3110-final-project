  A standard game of chess that is playable through the terminal. The interface is drawn using ASCII characters and they can enter the move using standard chess notation. A player can choose to play as white, black, or random. We will use trees and probability to mathematically determine the best move by searching possible combinations up to a certain depth. We may also have a second mode for the game where the user can play against another user possibly across different devices.
